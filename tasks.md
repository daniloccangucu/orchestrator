### Step-by-Step Plan for the Orchestrator Project

Here's a detailed plan to complete the Orchestrator project in 5 days, incorporating the requirements and ensuring you meet the audit criteria.

#### Day 1: Project Setup and Initial Configuration

1. **Understand the Project Requirements (2 hours):**
   - Carefully read through the project README and the audit requirements.
   - Familiarize yourself with the key components: Kubernetes architecture, Docker, and the specific microservices (billing-app, billing-database, inventory-app, inventory-database, RabbitMQ, API Gateway).

2. **Set Up the Development Environment (2 hours):**
   - Install necessary tools: Vagrant, VirtualBox, kubectl, and Docker.
   - Create a new directory for the project and initialize version control with Git.

3. **Prepare Docker Images (4 hours):**
   - Verify that you have the Docker images for billing-app, billing-database, inventory-app, inventory-database, RabbitMQ, and API Gateway.
   - Push these images to Docker Hub to make them accessible for Kubernetes.

4. **Create Docker Compose File (2 hours):**
   - Draft a `docker-compose.yml` file to ensure all services can run together.
   - Test the Docker Compose setup to ensure all services are running correctly.

#### Day 2: Kubernetes Cluster Setup

1. **Set Up K3s Cluster (3 hours):**
   - Use Vagrant to create two virtual machines (Master and Agent) as specified.
   - Install and configure K3s on both VMs.
   - Verify the cluster setup using `kubectl get nodes`.

2. **Write Kubernetes Manifests (4 hours):**
   - Create YAML manifests for each microservice, ensuring proper configurations for deployments, services, and ingresses.
   - Include necessary secrets for database credentials and other sensitive information.

3. **Deploy Applications to the Cluster (3 hours):**
   - Apply the manifests to the K3s cluster.
   - Verify the deployments using `kubectl get pods` and ensure all services are running.

#### Day 3: Implementing Additional Features

1. **Implement Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (4 hours):**
   - Configure the horizontal pod autoscalers for `api-gateway` and `inventory-app`.
   - Set the appropriate CPU utilization thresholds and test scaling.

2. **Set Up StatefulSets for Databases and Billing-App (3 hours):**
   - Ensure persistent storage is configured correctly for PostgreSQL databases and billing-app.
   - Test the StatefulSets by checking data persistence across pod restarts.

3. **Configure RabbitMQ and API Gateway (2 hours):**
   - Ensure RabbitMQ is correctly set up and integrated with billing-app.
   - Verify that the API Gateway is routing requests properly to the respective services.

#### Day 4: Monitoring, Logging, and Security

1. **Set Up Centralized Logging (3 hours):**
   - Implement a centralized logging system using tools like ELK stack.
   - Ensure all services are configured to send logs to the centralized system.

2. **Implement Monitoring (4 hours):**
   - Set up Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring the cluster and services.
   - Create dashboards to visualize key metrics and alerts for potential issues.

3. **Enhance Security (2 hours):**
   - Apply security best practices such as running containers with the least privilege.
   - Implement network policies to restrict unnecessary communication between services.

#### Day 5: Testing, Documentation, and Final Touches

1. **Perform Comprehensive Testing (3 hours):**
   - Conduct integration tests to ensure all services work together seamlessly.
   - Test failure scenarios and autoscaling to ensure robustness.

2. **Document the Solution (4 hours):**
   - Write detailed documentation including setup instructions, configurations, and usage guidelines.
   - Ensure the README.md file covers all aspects of the project and is clear for future reference.

3. **Prepare for Audit (2 hours):**
   - Review the audit requirements and ensure all criteria are met.
   - Gather evidence such as screenshots, logs, and outputs to demonstrate compliance.
